<h1>Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h1>
<p>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. <br>These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, <br>null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each<br> (depending on their types).

    Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as <br>reference data-types.
    An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a <br>pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.<br> The variables don’t actually store the value.
    
    Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, <br>of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are <br>called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
    
    For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods <br>like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.</p>
